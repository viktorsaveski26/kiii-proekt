# Backend_SpringBoot_Application
This is a quiz with questions with given answers. The way it works is:
The spring project is connected to a postgres database, using Pg Admin 4. It is fetching data from the db. It is only a backend program. 
It was tested with Postman to see if it works correctly. If you want you can do that and test the project.
